### Hey, I'm Mike 👋

I'm a senior front-end–leaning full-stack engineer with 16+ years of experience building performant, scalable web apps and platforms. These days, I’m focused on React, Next.js, and design systems that actually make devs’ lives easier. I’ve also done plenty of backend work with Node.js and .NET Core, built GraphQL and REST APIs, and shipped to production on AWS and Azure.

Big fan of clean UI, fast page loads, and thoughtful DX. I’ve led cross-team initiatives, mentored engineers, and contributed to open-source tools that help teams move faster.

When I’m not coding, I’m probably iterating on a weird game prototype or tweaking VSCode extensions I made to save myself time:

- 🧱 [Better CSS Stacking Contexts](https://github.com/mrheault/vscode-better-css-stacking-contexts) – visualizes z-index stacking context issues in CSS/SCSS
- ⚛️ [React + Next.js Component Generator](https://github.com/mrheault/vscode-react-nextjs-generator) – generate boilerplate React components with tests and styles, customizable

Some things I’m into:
- 🛠 Frontend architecture & performance tuning  
- 📦 Design systems & component libraries  
- ⚡️ Event-driven systems & AI integrations  
- 🎮 Indie game development (currently in Godot)
