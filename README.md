### Hey, I'm Mike 👋

I’m a senior full-stack engineer with a front-end focus, experienced in building performant, scalable web apps and platforms. Lately, I’ve been deep in React, Next.js, and TypeScript—building design systems and modular UIs that let teams ship faster and more consistently.

I’ve also worked across the stack with Node.js and .NET Core, designed GraphQL and REST APIs, and shipped production code on Vercel, AWS, and Azure. I care about clean UI, fast page loads, and thoughtful DX. I’ve led cross-team projects, mentored junior engineers, and driven architecture decisions that improved both performance and developer velocity.

When I’m not coding, I’m probably iterating on a my indie game prototype or tweaking VSCode extensions I made to save myself and others time:

- 🧱 [Better CSS Stacking Contexts](https://github.com/mrheault/vscode-better-css-stacking-contexts) – visualizes z-index stacking context issues in CSS/SCSS
- ⚛️ [React + Next.js Component Generator](https://github.com/mrheault/vscode-react-nextjs-generator) – generate boilerplate React components with tests and styles, customizable

Some things I’m into:
- 🛠 Frontend architecture & performance tuning  
- 📦 Design systems & component libraries  
- ⚡️ Event-driven systems & AI integrations  
- 🎮 Indie game development (currently in Godot)
